# Getting Started

```bash
amplify add api
GraphQL
localdev
API key
Annotated shema? No
Guided schema creation? Yes
Single object with fields
Edit the schema now? No
```

When defining a GraphQL schema, we can use directives from the GraphQL Transformer in local mocking as well as local code generation from the schema for GraphQL operations. The following directives are currently supported in the local mocking environment:
- @model
- @auth
- @key
- @connection
- @versioned
- @functioned

The same GraphQL schema generated by the Amplify CLI has a single "Todo" Type defined with @model, which means the GraphQL Transformer will automatically create a GraphQL API with an extended schema containing queries, mutations, and subscriptions with built-in CRUDL logic to access a DynamoDB table, also automatically deployed. It basically creates a fully-fledged API backend in seconds:

type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}

At this point, our API is ready for some local development! We can fire up our local AppSync and DynamoDB resources by executing one of these two commands:

```javascript
amplify mock
amplify mock api
```

*amplify mock* will test all supported local resources

*amplify mock api* will specifically test the GraphQL and watch as a local mock endpoint starts up. Code will automatically be generated and validated for queries, mutations, subscriptions and a local AppSync mock endpoint will start up.
